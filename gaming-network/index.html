            <h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
            <p> Sony has announced its latest Spider-Man release is the fastest-selling video game made by PlayStation.
                Spider-Man 2 sold more than 2.5 million physical and digital copies in its first 24 hours,Spider-Man 2 was one of a series of high profile games launched last week, including new titles from gaming icons Mario and Sonic.
                Super Mario Bros Wonder and Sonic Superstars drew headlines after the gaming rivals released games in the same week, for the first time for more than 30 years.
                Spider-Man 2 outperformed both in boxed sales to be the biggest physical video-game launch in the UK last week. It is now one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 titles on gaming-aggregator Metacritic.
                Despite being the biggest physical launch of the year on PS5, the game has not yet reached the dizzying heights of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which sold more than 10 million copies in just three days.
                That game, released by Nintendo in May, remains the biggest physical video game launch in the UK in 2023.
                The physical sales of Spider-Man 2 only make up part of the total 2.5 million copies sold - which Christopher Dring, head of gaming news site GamesIndustry.biz, said would have mainly been downloads.
                "The majority of games sold these days are digitally downloaded," he said.
                "The market was heading in this direction before the pandemic hit - in 2019 in the UK, around half of games were sold digitally while half were sold in physical stores, but since 2020, that number has jumped and over 70% of games are downloaded.
                "There are still millions of boxed games sold every year, and you can't download a console or a controller. But it is now a much, much, much smaller part of the market."

            <h2>Roblox</h2>
            <p>
            Roblox is a massive app — as of September 2023, Roblox says it has more than 65 million daily active users — and it's becoming an increasingly interesting platform to watch amid growing competition from social and metaverse platforms like Epic Games' Fortnite and Meta's Horizon Worlds.
            While Roblox has traditionally been associated as a platform for kids, the company has done a lot of work as of late to make it more appealing to older audiences. The platform now allows developers to make experiences that are exclusively accessible to users that are 17 and over, for example, and is introducing its own spin on video chat. It even has ambitions to be a place where adults can meet and date.
            The company is also investing heavily into generative AI tools to help creators make experiences more easily, including a new Roblox Assistant AI chatbot.

            <h2>Mario v Sonic</h2>
            <p>
                People of a certain age will remember growing up with this debate dominating conversations at school in the '90s.
                Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog led the gaming charts back then, and ultimately became two of the most recognisable faces in the industry, spanning countless spin-offs and even recent feature films.
                The debate began to fade as the mascots moved into 3D games, and has now all but vanished as they both star in tie-in games for the Olympics.
                But the rivalry may yet be speeding back after a landmark event, with the two rivals having released games in the same week for the first time for more than 30 years.
                The last time this happened was in 1992, when Super Mario Land 2 and Sonic 2 both came out in the last week of November in the UK.
                Sonic Superstars, which was released on Tuesday, and Super Mario Bros Wonder, which came out on Friday, are both about returning to the series' roots.
