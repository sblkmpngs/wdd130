            <h2>Far Cry 6</h2>
            <p>
                Far Cry 6 will no longer receive future updates but online services will continue
                Ubisoft has announced that Far Cry 6 will no longer receive updates, but players will still be able to
                access the game's online services.
                In a new statement shared on Twitter on November 1, Ubisoft said: "Thanks to the millions of players who
                joined the fight. Your adventures can continue in Yara without interruption of online services. However,
                the dev team will no longer be making updates to Far Cry 6.
                "We appreciate your passion, creativity and love of Chorizo, even Anton is proud."

                    The runaway success of Fortnite OG continues, and so you don't get any FOM-OG, we've got everything
                    you need to know about the update - with when and what to expect from next OG revamp.
                    As we alluded to, a lot of players have taken up the pickaxe to explore familiar pastures in the
                    original map from a time when Covid and the pandemic would have been disregarded as the crazed
                    ravings of a doomsday cult.
                    Each week is seeing a new (old) season, and it's no different this time. You can check out how the
                    whole thing has played out and what's yet to come in our Fortnite Season OG schedule.
                    You can also get a glimpse of all the skins, loot, weapons and vehicles in the Fortnite OG Battle
                    Pass.

                <h2>Texas Chain Saw Massacre</h2>
                <p>
                    The Texas Chain Saw Massacre creators Sumo Nottingham and Gun Interactive shared an early look at
                    what's coming in the game's next update, and like some of the past updates that have looked to
                    quicken the pace of matches, this one does something similar. This particular update removes
                    Grandpa's cutscene, the one that plays whenever The Family's patriarch is stirred from his slumber
                    by noise from The Victims. The same update also takes a look at another member of The Family, the
                    Cook, by nerfing his Victim-detecting ability among other changes all detailed in the latest edition
                    of The Muerto Times.
                    The update itself is not yet out, and the full patch notes that'll be released later will give a
                    better idea of what, exactly, is changing. It sounds like a lot will be changing, too, be it in this
                    update or in several future ones over time considering how Sumo Nottingham said that it's looking
                    into over 250 different issues with the game.
                    And so far, it seems as though the community is receiving the early patch notes pretty well. The
                    Grandpa change in particular is one that makes sense -- the character waking up is a key part of
                    every game, so having a cutscene to signify it happening every single time is something that quickly
                    gets old.
