            <h2>Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
            <p> 
                Assassin's Creed Mirage is a triumphant homage to its earliest predecessors, but it still suffers from issues endemic to the series. The stealth action game from Ubisoft Bordeaux is singularly engaging and refreshing in its constricted scope; still, tiresome trends from the series at large return, making key components of its story vapid distractions from its true strengths. While Mirage is clearly built upon the back of 2020's AC Valhalla, that foundation has been morphed into an experience heavily reminiscent of the original Assassin s Creed from 2007. Mirage is a more than worthwhile entry to the long-running saga in its own right, but it also shows that the original vision of the series still has immense potential. Despite its more compact vision, it manages to encapsulate exactly what it means to be an Assassin's Creed game. From the more classic costuming to the focus on stealth and streamlined parkour, this is a beautiful return to the classic games. And oh boy does it look good doing it.Ubisoft Bordeaux has delivered exactly what it promised. Assassin's Creed Mirage is a compact, stealth-focused adventure that punishes anyone trying to go in loud, and it does so in a world that's always a delight to explore (and be chased through).

            <h2>Mortal Kombat 1</h2>
            <p>
                NetherRealm Studios cares deeply about Mortal Kombat's lore. That might seem a little silly given the franchise-s penchant for grotesque bodily dismemberment and South Park-ish bathroom humor, but over the course of the last decade — after Mortal Kombat made a glorious return to a 2D fighting plane — the company has generated some truly epic, MCU-sized sagas for its cast of ninjas, demons, and miscreants. Mortal Kombat I, a reboot of the chronology, is no different. The single-player campaign essentially functions as a full-length animated feature with a couple brawls dropped into the interstitial moments, and the multiplayer ladder is as sound as ever. This might not be the most imaginative take on the 30-year legacy of the series, but NetherRealm has shown, over and over again, that they will stick to their guns.

            <h2>Immortals of Aveum</h2>
            <p>
                I often find myself thinking about how familiar I've become with firearm nomenclature after too many hours playing first-person shooters like Call of Duty and Counter-Strike. I've never fired a gun in my life, but through pure osmosis, I do know the difference between an M16 and an AK-47. Immortals of Aveum, then, offers us a much more imaginative suite of options. This is an FPS where we're sat behind the eyes of a young, devil-may-care warlock, who expels destructive magical beams from his fingertips at a machine-gun clip. Like its contemporaries in Doom and Wolfenstein, solving Aveum requires players to identify the exact cocktail of magical munitions that will sunder the armor of the demons and goblins in our midst. (Personally, I'm a fan of the crackling, lightning-blue whip we can use to pull enemies in close for a shotgun blast of pure energy.) But by shifting the basics ever so slightly, Aveum has discovered a compelling new way to be a shooter. Magic just looks better on screen than those boring old payloads of shrapnel and lead.
