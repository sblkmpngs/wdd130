        Sony has announced its latest Spider-Man release is the fastest-selling video game made by PlayStation.
Spider-Man 2 sold more than 2.5 million physical and digital copies in its first 24 hours,Spider-Man 2 was one of a series of high profile games launched last week, including new titles from gaming icons Mario and Sonic.
Super Mario Bros Wonder and Sonic Superstars drew headlines after the gaming rivals released games in the same week, for the first time for more than 30 years.
Spider-Man 2 outperformed both in boxed sales to be the biggest physical video-game launch in the UK last week. It is now one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 titles on gaming-aggregator Metacritic.
Despite being the biggest physical launch of the year on PS5, the game has not yet reached the dizzying heights of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which sold more than 10 million copies in just three days.
That game, released by Nintendo in May, remains the biggest physical video game launch in the UK in 2023.
The physical sales of Spider-Man 2 only make up part of the total 2.5 million copies sold - which Christopher Dring, head of gaming news site GamesIndustry.biz, said would have mainly been downloads.
"The majority of games sold these days are digitally downloaded," he said.
"The market was heading in this direction before the pandemic hit - in 2019 in the UK, around half of games were sold digitally while half were sold in physical stores, but since 2020, that number has jumped and over 70% of games are downloaded.
"There are still millions of boxed games sold every year, and you can't download a console or a controller. But it is now a much, much, much smaller part of the market."

        Assassin's Creed Mirage is a triumphant homage to its earliest predecessors, but it still suffers from issues endemic to the series. The stealth action game from Ubisoft Bordeaux is singularly engaging and refreshing in its constricted scope; still, tiresome trends from the series at large return, making key components of its story vapid distractions from its true strengths. While Mirage is clearly built upon the back of 2020's AC Valhalla, that foundation has been morphed into an experience heavily reminiscent of the original Assassin s Creed from 2007. Mirage is a more than worthwhile entry to the long-running saga in its own right, but it also shows that the original vision of the series still has immense potential.
Despite its more compact vision, it manages to encapsulate exactly what it means to be an Assassin's Creed game. From the more classic costuming to the focus on stealth and streamlined parkour, this is a beautiful return to the classic games. And oh boy does it look good doing it.Ubisoft Bordeaux has delivered exactly what it promised. Assassin's Creed Mirage is a compact, stealth-focused adventure that punishes anyone trying to go in loud, and it does so in a world that's always a delight to explore (and be chased through).
